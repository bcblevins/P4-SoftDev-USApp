from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from django.http import HttpResponse
from reviews import views as review_views

# Temporary home view so LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL works
def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1>Welcome, you are logged in!</h1>")

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("", review_views.home, name="home"),  # home page at root
    path("users/", include("users.urls")),  # add URL patterns from users app
    path("reviews/", include("reviews.urls")),  # add URL patterns from reviews app
]
